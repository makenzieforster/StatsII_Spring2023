\section*{Question 1}
\vspace{.25cm}
\noindent We are interested in how governments' management of public resources impacts economic prosperity. Our data come from \href{https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Adam_Przeworski/publication/240357392_Classifying_Political_Regimes/links/0deec532194849aefa000000/Classifying-Political-Regimes.pdf}{Alvarez, Cheibub, Limongi, and Przeworski (1996)} and is labelled \texttt{gdpChange.csv} on GitHub. The dataset covers 135 countries observed between 1950 or the year of independence or the first year forwhich data on economic growth are available ("entry year"), and 1990 or the last year for which data on economic growth are available ("exit year"). The unit of analysis is a particular country during a particular year, for a total $>$ 3,500 observations. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item
	Response variable: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \texttt{GDPWdiff}: Difference in GDP between year $t$ and $t-1$. Possible categories include: "positive", "negative", or "no change"
	\end{itemize}

	\item
	Explanatory variables: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item
		\texttt{REG}: 1=Democracy; 0=Non-Democracy
		\item
		\texttt{OIL}: 1=if the average ratio of fuel exports to total exports in 1984-86 exceeded 50\%; 0= otherwise
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{itemize}
\newpage
\noindent Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Construct and interpret an unordered multinomial logit with \texttt{GDPWdiff} as the output and "no change" as the reference category, including the estimated cutoff points and coefficients.
	
	\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
		data <- read.csv("datasets/gdpChange.csv")
		data$GDPWdiffleveled <- sign(data$GDPWdiff)
		data$GDPWdiffleveled <- factor(data$GDPWdiffleveled, levels = c("-1", "0", "1"), labels = c("negative", "no change", "positive"))
		data$GDPWdiffleveled <- relevel(data$GDPWdiffleveled, ref = "no change")
		
		#unordered multinomial logit
		mod1 <- multinom(GDPWdiffleveled ~ REG + OIL, data = data)
		mod1.2 <- exp(coef(mod1)[,c(1:3)])\end{lstlisting}
	\lstinputlisting{~/Documents/GitHub/POP77001_Computer_Programming_2022/StatsII_Spring2023/table1.txt}
	\lstinputlisting{~/Documents/GitHub/POP77001_Computer_Programming_2022/StatsII_Spring2023/table12.txt}
	\texttt{Oil export ratio was not a significant predictor in GDP change. Holding all else equal, in a given country there is an increase in baseline odds that GDP will grow by 5.9 times when the regime is a democracy}
	
	\item Construct and interpret an ordered multinomial logit with \texttt{GDPWdiff} as the outcome variable, including the estimated cutoff points and coefficients.
	\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
		mod2 <- polr(GDPWdiffleveled ~ REG + OIL, data = data, Hess = TRUE)
		(ci <- confint(mod2))
		mod2.2 <- exp(cbind(OR = coef(mod2), ci))\end{lstlisting}
	\lstinputlisting{~/Documents/GitHub/POP77001_Computer_Programming_2022/StatsII_Spring2023/table2.txt}
	\lstinputlisting{~/Documents/GitHub/POP77001_Computer_Programming_2022/StatsII_Spring2023/table22.txt}
	\texttt{Holding all else equal, in a given country there is an increase in baseline odds that GDP will grow (positive) by 1.5 times when the regime is a democracy compared with non democracies.}
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Question 2} 
\vspace{.25cm}

\noindent Consider the data set \texttt{MexicoMuniData.csv}, which includes municipal-level information from Mexico. The outcome of interest is the number of times the winning PAN presidential candidate in 2006 (\texttt{PAN.visits.06}) visited a district leading up to the 2009 federal elections, which is a count. Our main predictor of interest is whether the district was highly contested, or whether it was not (the PAN or their opponents have electoral security) in the previous federal elections during 2000 (\texttt{competitive.district}), which is binary (1=close/swing district, 0="safe seat"). We also include \texttt{marginality.06} (a measure of poverty) and \texttt{PAN.governor.06} (a dummy for whether the state has a PAN-affiliated governor) as additional control variables. 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item [(a)]
	Run a Poisson regression because the outcome is a count variable. Is there evidence that PAN presidential candidates visit swing districts more? Provide a test statistic and p-value.
	\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
		mod3 <- glm(PAN.visits.06 ~ competitive.district + marginality.06 + PAN.governor.06, data = dat, family = poisson))\end{lstlisting}
	\lstinputlisting{~/Documents/GitHub/POP77001_Computer_Programming_2022/StatsII_Spring2023/table3.txt}
	\texttt{test statistic = -0.477}
	
	\texttt{p value = 0.6336}
	
	\texttt{Competitive District is not a significant predictor}

	\item [(b)]
	Interpret the \texttt{marginality.06} and \texttt{PAN.governor.06} coefficients.
	\lstinputlisting{~/Documents/GitHub/POP77001_Computer_Programming_2022/StatsII_Spring2023/table32.txt}
	\texttt{Holding all else equal, a one unit increase marginality increases the expected counts of a PAN candidate visiting a given district by a multiplicative factor of 0.1.}
	
	\texttt{Holding all else equal, the presence of a PAN increases the expected counts of# a PAN candidate visiting a given district by a multiplicative factor of 0.7.}
	
	\item [(c)]
	Provide the estimated mean number of visits from the winning PAN presidential candidate for a hypothetical district that was competitive (\texttt{competitive.district}=1), had an average poverty level (\texttt{marginality.06} = 0), and a PAN governor (\texttt{PAN.governor.06}=1).
	\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
		cfs <- coef(mod3)
		exp(cfs[1] + cfs[2]*1 + cfs[3]*0 + cfs[4]*1)\end{lstlisting}
	\texttt{Estimated mean visits = 0.01494818}
	
\end{enumerate}
